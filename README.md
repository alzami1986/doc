Stuff from my Ph.D.

1. Directories
 - academic papers: journal and conference papers and thesis
 - database: CNRC data from [1]
 - matlab: Matlab scripts to preprocess the data and analyze the results
 - obj: objects created from the source code
 - savedStuff: results, swarms, and networks saved by the experiments
 - src: C++ source code

2. How to run the things (i.e., multisemble, standing for multiple
   objective ensembles detailed in [2])
 - Build the code with the makefile
 - The configurations are defined in config.txt (defaut value of the 
   executable multisemble)
 - run multisemble
