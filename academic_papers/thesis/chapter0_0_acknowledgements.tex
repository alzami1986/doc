I would like to express my thanks to Prof. Ã‰ric Granger and Prof. Robert Sabourin, my research supervisor and co-supervisor, for their assistance, support, and guidance throughout this research work.
I also gratefully acknowledge their financial support.

My gratitude also goes to members of my thesis committee: Prof. Pierre Dumouchel, Prof. Umapada Pal, and Prof. Luc Duong for for evaluating this thesis and providing constructive comments.

I would like to thank all my colleagues at the LIVIA (Laboratoire d'imagerie, de vision et d'intelligence artificielle), for sharing many ideas and Vins et Fromages with me, and for making this experience easier than it could have been.
I will not name them in case I forget someone, but you know who you are.
In particular, I would like to thank \'{E}ric Thibodeau for his technical expertise.
He has been a lifesaver more than once.

Most of all, I would like to thank my girlfriend, Laurence Lachapelle-B\'{e}gin, for being by my side all these years.
She has been most patient, supportive and encouraging through all this journey.
I dedicate this thesis to her.

I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to my parents for the support they provided me through my entire life.
